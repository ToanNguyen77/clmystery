You're concerned that the investigation has been compromised. You use an old detective trick to cover your tracks.

To recover your 'step5' file, use the `git checkout` command to check out the 'step-5' branch, and try to view this file again.

You found two witness interview files. Take a look inside both of them and save any useful information into a new file called 'interview_info.txt'.
